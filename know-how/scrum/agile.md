## Agile Development

Agile development uses four clear delivery methods to bring structure to any project: versions, sprints, epics, and user stories

* __VERSION__ is a set of features and fixes released together as a single update to your product. Assigning issues to versions helps you plan the order in which new features (stories) for your product will be released to your customers. A version can be made up of multiple sprints
* __SPRINT__ is a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review
* __EPIC__ captures a large body of work. It is essentially a large user story that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories. It may take several sprints to complete an epic.
* __USER STORY__ (represented as an issue) captures a description of a feature from an end-user perspective. The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement. User stories are broken up into individual tasks that make up the story (represented as sub-tasks in Jira)
